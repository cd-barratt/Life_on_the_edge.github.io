# Life_on_the_edge

Life on the edge is a novel informatic toolbox that enables the user to input environmental (e.g. climate, land use), ecological (e.g. spatial occurrences, and evolutionary (e.g. genome-wide molecular) data to predict vulnerability to global change. The toolbox consists of a series of scripts and functions that can perform a number of complex analyses (e.g. genomic data processing, Species Distribution Modelling, landscape connectivity analyses, Genotype-Environment Association analysis and simulations) and can be run from start to finish to go from raw data to population vunerability maps and tables. It aims to integrate analyses and increase reproducibility across species and geographic areas to help standardise climate change vulnerability assessments and aid conservation prioritisation and monitoring efforts.
