# Life_on_the_edge

Life on the edge is a novel informatic toolbox that enables the user to input environmental (e.g. climate, land use), ecological (e.g. spatial occurrences, and evolutionary (e.g. genome-wide molecular) data to predict vulnerability to global change. The toolbox consists of 22 interconnected scripts that can be run from start to finish to go from raw data to population vunerability maps and tables. It aims to aid climate change vulnerability assessments and conservation prioritisation.
