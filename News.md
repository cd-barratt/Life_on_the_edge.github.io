### Code update - 23.12.24

Uploaded a new version of the code [here](https://github.com/cd-barratt/Life_on_the_edge). Some people had issues with slightly different versions of R packages that were used for LOtE, so the updated setup script should make this easier now (contains all_R_packages_list.csv which definitively controls the version numbers of R packages that are installed in to the singularity container). 

Also made some minor fixes in the simulation scripts for local adaptation analyses as I ran into some issues with some newer datasets I was testing.
